The flowers were collected monthly (from March to October, i.e., during the usual flowering season of the plant) at three localities in three different years. Total flavonoids were determined spectrophotometrically by two methods: by formation of a complex with aluminium chloride after acidic hydrolysis of flower extracts (method 1) and by reaction with boric and oxalic acids in extracts without their modification (method 2). Total phenolics were determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The antioxidant activity was determined spectrophotometrically by a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The contents of flavonoids varied from 0.31 to 0.44 mg quercetin equivalent/100 mg dry weight (method 1) and from 1.37 to 2.20 mg pigenin-7-glucoside equivalent/100 mg dry weight (method 2). Total phenolics ranged from 2.81 to 3.57 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 mg dry weight. The antioxidant activity expressed as IC(50) values varied from 66.03 to 89.27 \u00b5g/mL; it is about 50, 30, 20, and 10 times lower as compared with quercetin, ascorbic acid, Trolox\u00ae, and butylhydroxytoluene, respectively, and about five times higher in comparison with apigenin-7-glucoside. There is a significant correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolics. No correlation between total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity was observed. Contents of phenolics and flavonoids as well as antioxidant activity of daisy flowers vary to a relatively small extent during the year and are not dependant on the time of collection. Thus, the flowers possess comparable quality as to these characteristics over the whole flowering season of Bellis perennis. Effects of environmental factors on the amounts of secondary metabolites in plants are also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Charles University in Prague, Heyrovsk\u00e9ho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic. tomas.siatka@faf.cuni.cz"}], "LastName": "Siatka", "ForeName": "Tom\u00e1\u0161", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ka\u0161parov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Marie", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sensors (Basel). 2009;9(7):5702-14", "ArticleIdList": ["22346723"]}, {"Citation": "Fitoterapia. 2001 Nov;72(7):839-40", "ArticleIdList": ["11677029"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2001 Oct;49(10):4977-82", "ArticleIdList": ["11600054"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1999 Jun;47(6):2226-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10794614"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Pharm Ber Dtsch Pharm Ges. 1960 Dec;293/65:1033-42", "ArticleIdList": ["13693338"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 1997 Dec;63(6):503-7", "ArticleIdList": ["9434600"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo). 2008 Apr;56(4):559-68", "ArticleIdList": ["18379108"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1999 Apr;47(4):1749-54", "ArticleIdList": ["10564049"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2004 Dec 15;52(25):7574-9", "ArticleIdList": ["15675806"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Pol Pharm. 2000 Mar-Apr;57(2):129-30", "ArticleIdList": ["10934792"]}, {"Citation": "Ceska Slov Farm. 2003 Jan;52(1):39-41", "ArticleIdList": ["12685333"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Chem. 2006 Apr;52(4):749-52", "ArticleIdList": ["16469857"]}, {"Citation": "J Photochem Photobiol B. 2000 Sep;57(2-3):179-85", "ArticleIdList": ["11154084"]}, {"Citation": "Molecules. 2010 Nov 29;15(12):8602-17", "ArticleIdList": ["21116229"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Pol Pharm. 2001 Sep-Oct;58(5):401-4", "ArticleIdList": ["11876448"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2005 May 18;53(10):4290-302", "ArticleIdList": ["15884874"]}, {"Citation": "Mini Rev Med Chem. 2008 Nov;8(13):1429-40", "ArticleIdList": ["18991758"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Chim Acta. 2009 Feb 16;634(1):54-60", "ArticleIdList": ["19154810"]}, {"Citation": "J Photochem Photobiol B. 2000 Dec;59(1-3):64-71", "ArticleIdList": ["11332892"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21178900", "molecules15129450", "10.3390/molecules15129450", "PMC6259450"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
