The qualitative analysis was carried out by TLC and compared with flavonoid compounds isolated from flowers of common daisy. The quantitative determinations were carried out by Christ-M\u00fcller's method and by HPLC after acid hydrolysis. Similar flavonoids were found in all the flowers, while differences were noted in the flavonoid composition of the leaves. The flavonoid contents were higher in the flowers than in the leaves.", "date_completed": "20020423", "date_revised": "20161124"}
