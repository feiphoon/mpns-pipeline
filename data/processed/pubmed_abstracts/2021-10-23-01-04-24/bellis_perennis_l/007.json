(daisy) and the grass Cynosurus cristatus L. (crested dog's-tail) have been measured. The plants were grown in the natural environment and ambient daylight was supplemented with five different UV irradiances centred at eight different wavelengths (313, 318, 320, 322, 339, 348, 356 and 377 nm). Destructive growth analysis was performed on B. perennis and C. cristatus after 300 and 122 days respectively. Dose response curves were created to construct action spectra for individual responses. Different spectral responses were observed in these two plant types. B. perennis exhibited a substantial action maximum at 313 nm for the inhibition of aerial, root and total dry weight; a similar action maximum at 313 nm for the inhibition of leaf expansion was observed. Longer wavelengths were relatively ineffective on these growth parameters, with the exception of a small but statistically significant (P < 0.05) response to 320 nm radiation. By contrast, C. cristatus showed negligible response to 313 nm radiation, for inhibition of aerial, root and total dry weight but substantial responses to longer wavelengths, especially at 339 and 348 nm. These action spectra add weight to suggestions in the literature that UV-A has a role to play in responses in this region of the spectrum. The possible implications of these observations are discussed.", "date_completed": "20011204", "date_revised": "20190921"}
