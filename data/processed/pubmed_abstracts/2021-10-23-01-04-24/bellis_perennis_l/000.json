Its principal constituents are saponins. The paper examined the haemolytic activity of the drug obtained by the collection of the capitula of Bellis perennis L. in a one month interval (from March to October) in the course of three years. The determination of haemolytic activity was carried out following the method of Pharmacopoea Bohemoslovaca IV. It has been found that the haemolytic activity of the drug changes in dependence on the time of collection of capitula during the year; it is lowest in March, then it increases, reaching the maximum in summer months (June, July, August), and then it decreases again.", "date_completed": "20030428", "date_revised": "20061115"}
