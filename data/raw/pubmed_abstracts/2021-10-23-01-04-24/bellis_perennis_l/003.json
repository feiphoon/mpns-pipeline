Twelve male adult Wistar rats were used. Six wounds were created for each animal by using circular excision wound model. The first two wounds were treated topically with HOTBp (hydrophilic ointment treatment containing n-butanol fraction). The second two wounds were control group and not treated with anything. The third two wounds were treated only with HOT (hydrophilic ointment treatment without n-butanol fraction). Treatments were applied once a day and lasted for 30 days. Wound samples were excised on days 5(th), 10(th) and 30(th). The percentage of wound healing was calculated by Walker's formula after measurement of the wound area and the tissue samples were examined histopathologically.", "The percentages of wound closure (HOTBp: 100%; HOT: 85% and control: 87%) and histopathological observations showed that there were statistically significant differences between HOTBp, HOT and control groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at 30(th) day.", "Topically administered ointment prepared from the n-butanol fraction of B. perennis flowers has a wound healing potential without scar formation in circular excision wound model in rats. Thus, traditional usage of wound healing activity of B. perennis was scientifically verified for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey. fatmapehlivankarakas@gmail.com"}], "LastName": "Karaka\u015f", "ForeName": "Fatma Pehlivan", "Initials": "FP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karaka\u015f", "ForeName": "Alper", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boran", "ForeName": "\u00c7etin", "Initials": "\u00c7"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "T\u00fcrker", "ForeName": "Arzu U\u00e7ar", "Initials": "AU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yal\u00e7in", "ForeName": "Funda Nuray", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bilensoy", "ForeName": "Erem", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cicatrix, Hypertrophic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds, Penetrating"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22775421", "10.3109/13880209.2012.656200"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
